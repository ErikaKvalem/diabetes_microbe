## Structure of this repository

01-documentation: Contains initial metadata about samples and data files that are used for downstream analysis. This includes locations of comparative data.

02-scripts: Contains all scripts and code notebooks used in the day-to-day analysis during the project. Can optionally include sub-directories for each language (e.g., R, python).

03-data: Contains all the large raw, or common-starting point files for all downstream analyses. For (meta)genomics these are normally files such as BAM, SAM, FASTQ, FASTA etc.

04-analysis: Contains all the output from software, tools, and notebooks of all analyses. This is the main 'working' directory of the project.

05-results: Contains copies of all final output from all 04-analysis (i.e., without intermediate files). These will be used for the bare-minimal reproducible results for reports and publication.

06-reports: Contains presentations, summary notebooks of particular stages or packages of the project. Used for informing the final publication.

07-publication: Contains main text, figures, supplementary files and data. Optionally can formatted with bookdown for pretty online rendering with direct links to intermediate files in 04-analysis
